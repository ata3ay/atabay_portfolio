# atabay_portfolio

This repository contains my academic and personal programming projects.
For clarity, all projects are grouped into three categories.

## 📁 TU_Graz_programming_projects

This folder includes **C programming projects** developed during my studies at **TU Graz**.
All source files are stored directly in this repository.

### Examples of projects:
- `blackjack.c` — Blackjack game using dynamic memory, structs, enums, and file I/O  
- `cinema_project.c` — Cinema booking system  
- `image_structuring_program.c` — Image processing with BMP structures  
- `stringtango.c` — Text editor project with dynamic memory management  
- `password_validator.c` — String and pointer-based validation logic  

These projects demonstrate:
- structured programming in C  
- dynamic memory management  
- pointers, arrays, structs, enums  
- file input/output

## 📁 TU_Graz_computer_systems_project

This folder contains projects related to **Computer Systems & Networks**.

Instead of duplicating repositories, each project is referenced via a text file:

- `GitHub_link.txt` — contains a direct link to the corresponding GitHub repository

This section focuses on:
- system-level concepts  
- networking and security topics  
- collaborative university projects

## 📁 TU_Graz_stats_project

This folder includes projects related to **statistics, data analysis, and quantitative methods**.

Project repositories are linked via:
- `GitHub_link.txt` — direct link to the full project repository

These projects typically involve:
- data analysis  
- statistical reasoning  
- academic reporting

## ℹ️ Notes

- Some university projects are stored in separate repositories due to course regulations.
- This portfolio repository serves as a **structured overview** of my work.
- Each linked project contains its own documentation.
