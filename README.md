# TU Graz projects

This repository contains my academic and personal programming projects.  
For clarity, all projects are grouped into three categories.

---

## 📁 TU_Graz_programming_projects

This folder includes **C programming projects** developed during my studies at **TU Graz**.  
All source files are stored directly in this repository.

### Examples of projects:
- `blackjack.c` — Blackjack game using dynamic memory, structs, enums, and file I/O
- `cinema_project.c` — Cinema booking system
- `image_structuring_program.c` — Image processing with BMP structures
- `stringtango.c` — Text editor project with dynamic memory management
- `password_validator.c` — String and pointer-based validation logic

These projects demonstrate:
- structured programming in C
- dynamic memory management
- pointers, arrays, structs, enums
- file input/output

**🛠️ Languages & Tools:** `C`

## 📁 TU_Graz_computer_systems_project

This folder contains projects related to **Computer Systems, Networks, and LLM Security**.

### 🔐 LLM Friend or Foe — Guardrail Pipeline for LLM Safety

This project explores **security risks of Large Language Models (LLMs)** and demonstrates how intent-shifted prompts can be detected and mitigated using a judge-then-answer guardrail pipeline.

The system analyzes each user query before responding by:
- detecting intent shifts, harmful domains, and jailbreak attempts,
- assigning a risk level (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH),
- applying a safety policy (ALLOW / SAFE_COMPLETE / REFUSE),
- generating only non-actionable, safe responses.

The project was developed as part of the course  
**"LLM – Friend or Foe: Security Risks & Defences"** and focuses on LLM safety, misuse prevention, and explainable defensive design.

**🛠️ Language:** `Python`

## 📁 TU_Graz_stats_project

This folder includes projects related to **statistics, data analysis, and quantitative methods**.

### 📊 CMS Project — Salary Analysis in AI and Data Science

This project analyzes salary data of professionals working in **Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** to study the impact of work experience on earnings.

Research question:  
Do professionals with more than five years of experience earn significantly more than those with 0–5 years of experience?

Key aspects:
- dataset from Kaggle (2020–2025)
- currency normalization (USD only)
- grouping by experience level
- statistical analysis using t-test and bootstrapping

**🛠️ Language:** `Python`

## 📁 TU_Graz_computational_social_systems

This folder includes projects related to **agent-based modelling and social simulation (CMSS course)**.

### 🎲 Prisoner's Dilemma

Agent-based simulation of the Prisoner's Dilemma using Mesa.  
Explores emergence of cooperation and defection in repeated interactions.

**🛠️ Tools:** Python · Mesa · Jupyter Notebook

---

### 🌊 Threshold Cascade Project — Social Influence & AI Opinion Adoption

Combines Axelrod cultural diffusion model with Granovetter threshold model to simulate opinion spreading.

Key aspects:
- cultural evolution via Axelrod model
- opinion dynamics (Pro-AI / Neutral / Anti-AI)
- threshold-based adoption under social influence
- analysis of tipping points and convergence

**🛠️ Tools:** Python · Mesa · Matplotlib · NumPy

---

### 🤖 CMSS Project — Social Influence and Public Opinions Towards AI

This project investigates how social influence shapes public opinions towards Artificial Intelligence (AI) in online social networks.

It combines:
- Axelrod Model of Cultural Dissemination
- Granovetter Threshold Model

Key focus:
- opinion formation under social influence
- consensus, polarization, fragmentation
- role of homophily and thresholds

Metrics:
- opinion distribution
- consensus level
- polarization
- number of opinion groups
- convergence time
- AI adoption rate

**🛠️ Tools:** Python · NetworkX · NumPy · Pandas · Matplotlib

## 📁 TU_Graz_forecasting_project

### 📈 Forecasting Industrial Production Using FRED-MD Data

Forecasting U.S. Industrial Production using macroeconomic data.

Models:
- AR(1), Random Walk
- OLS, Ridge, Lasso
- Principal Component Regression (PCR)

Result:
Ridge regression achieved best performance (lowest RMSE).

**🛠️ Tools:** R · glmnet · ggplot2
